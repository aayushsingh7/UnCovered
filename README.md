## 🧩 The Problem

In today’s digital age, misinformation spreads faster than ever — not just during major events like conflicts or elections, but **every single day**.

From AI-generated images and deepfakes to fake headlines and out-of-context quotes, our feeds are flooded with misleading content. And now, it’s not just text — **infographics, screenshots, viral videos, and visual edits** are weaponized to mislead.

I saw this firsthand during the recent India-Pakistan tensions — my social media was filled with AI-generated visuals, fake news clips, and viral claims. But even outside of that, I still encounter suspicious content daily.

It’s not just me. These problems are everywhere:

- **AI-generated content** makes it hard to separate fact from fiction  
- **Most tools only support text**, or at best, basic image analysis — **no screenshots, no video frames, no real-time capture**  
- Even trusted tools (like ChatGPT, Perplexity) break your flow:  
  pause → copy → switch tab → paste → read long output → decide  
- **People want instant, trusted verification** across all content types — without leaving the page

**The result?** Misinformation spreads because fact-checking is too fragmented, slow, and inconvenient.

### 📈 Some Stats

- Over **62%** of people see misleading information online each week. [Source](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/media-literacy/2022/survey-says-large-majority-think-they-see-misinformation-online-every-week/)

- Around **37%** of people say they don't fact-check because it takes too much time.

- **76%** (on average across 29 countries) think **artificial intelligence** is making it easier to generate very **realistic fake news**, **stories**, and **images**. [Source](https://www.ipsos.com/en-in/data-dive-fake-news-age-ai)

- Many users say **they would fact-check more often if the process were quicker**. [Source](https://www.lmu.de/en/newsroom/news-overview/news/artificial-intelligence-stemming-the-tide-of-fake-facts.html)

- A significant portion of people have **believed fake news was real** at least once. [Source](https://www.ipsos.com/en-in/data-dive-fake-news-age-ai)
